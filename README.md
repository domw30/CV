## Background
A fast-learning Language and Communication graduate with a passion for technology and its inner workings, who successfully secured a placement on the Makers Academy Fellowship scheme, motivated to develop and progress in a dynamic career as a Software Developer, with a real drive to learn led by curiosity, creativity and eagerness.

With experience undertaking highly demanding administration roles, I thrive in a creative and collaborative environment with strengths in problem solving, relationship building, communication and delivery of results. Now I take on a new challenge, to transfer my skills and experiences to reach my goal of becoming a competent and confident junior developer.

As a graduate of Makers Academy, I am looking for an exciting opportunity in the London tech industry. With interests in music, fitness, food and travel I will aim to join a software team working on innovative projects with beautiful design and user experience.

## Projects
Below is a selection of the projects I've worked on. Please look to my [Github](https://github.com/domw30) for a complete list.

| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [StarGazer](https://github.com/jo-quin/stargazer) | The final project of the Makers Academy curriculum, in a team of four, we aimed to create an iOS Augmented Reality App, built from the ground up using technologies that were new to each of us. Using the skills and experience gained throughout the bootcamp we put our heads together to create an app that generates 3D celestial bodies through a mobile devices camera based on user location and date. | 2 weeks | Swift, XCode (ARKit, SceneKit, UIKit) | Codacy, XCode built in CI |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/CalumDarroch/acebook-FiveGuys) | As a team of five we set off to create our own version of the social media platform Facebook. The primary goal of the Acebook Project was to be able to achieve and evidence that we have used high-quality processes to build a project in a team. The aim of the sites design was to strip back to a retro feel. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, Codacy |
| [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/domw30/rps-challenge) | A weekend challenge as part of the Makers Academy curriculum, I was asked to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors web application. The aim was to have a player vs computer game which involves the player choosing a move (rock, paper or scissors) to trump the computers randomly generated move.  | 1 weekend | Ruby, HTML/CSS, Sinatra | RSpec, Cabybara, Rubocop |

## Skills

#### Creativity
As someone who is inventive and has a key eye for detail, software development provides me with a platform to illustrate my creative potential, building practice projects using Ruby, HTML and CSS including:

 1. [The Prediction](https://github.com/domw30/The-Prediction-Game) - *A command-line game*
 2. [Student Directory](https://github.com/domw30/student-directory-2) - *A command-line app*
 3. [WLP](https://github.com/domw30/WLP-Portfolio) - *A portfolio website*
 4. [The Running Backpacker](https://github.com/domw30/Running-Backpacker) - *A fitness and travel blog*
 5. [Dino's Pizza](https://github.com/domw30/Pizza) - *A pizza takeaway website*

University introduced me to video editing software such as Final Cut Pro. In a team of three, we filmed, edited and presented a short documentary film, [Olympic Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMzfkjc_qE).

Drawing [sketches](https://github.com/domw30/CV/blob/master/sketches.pdf) of homepage layouts is another past time of mine. Using a software development mindset I picture how a page should be presented to a user. Some sketches include an online shop, a mobile sports app and a photographers portfolio page.

#### Communication
Throughout my previous roles, such as Recruitment Coordinator for Canterbury District Health Board and Compliance Audit Consultant for Lloyds Corporate Finance, communication has been vital internally and externally. I created professional correspondence in email form, telephony and mail on a daily basis. In addition, I have led workshops to train new colleagues and given presentations regarding new ideas and efficient work flows.

[Welcome to Makers](https://medium.com/@domw30/welcome-to-makers-academy-55318cc1457d) is a blog that I have created to communicate helpful hints and tips to new students of Makers Academy on how to manage the pre-course.

#### Fast-Learning
Ability to take on new challenges and projects learning new material and concepts effectively and efficiently. I have been able to approach and absorb a range of topics relevant to Software Development during my self-led learning such as Ruby language, prior to and during the pre-course with Makers Academy boot-camp. I have been able to work through online resources and books that have enabled me to develop command-line based projects that I have thoroughly enjoyed creating.

#### Self-Confidence
My self-confidence and personal development has benefitted from not only securing a place as a Fellow with Makers Academy, but also three years travelling and working in Europe, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. I believe that subjecting myself to a diverse range of employers and environments has significantly improved my ability to overcome obstacles that come with entering into the unknown, to be able to think practically and adapt to difficult situations.

During my time with Lloyds Finance, I achieved the highest ranking performance statistic for passing quality control checking, adhering to FSA rules, over a 6 month period which reflects my self-confidence and keen eye for detail, further transferable skills.

#### Commitment
Following many months of research and practice, I was incredibly committed to secure a place on the Makers Academy Fellowship Scheme. I was able to use self-led learning techniques to prepare for the application process and have the commitment to work everyday to ensure there was a possibility of being accepted. With discipline, focus and motivation I have been able to progress with my journey of becoming a software developer.
